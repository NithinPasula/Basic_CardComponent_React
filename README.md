# Basic Card Component

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, there are two official plugins available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md), which uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc), which uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
